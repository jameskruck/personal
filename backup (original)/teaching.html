                    <p class="mb-4">My teaching philosophy has evolved from traditional instruction to facilitating dynamic, student-centered learning environments. Initially following a "sage on the stage" model, I've moved toward creating spaces where learning is created, not dispensed. Through this journey, I've discovered that the best teaching emerges from collaborative environments where instructors and learners contribute to shared growth.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">I believe that teaching should foster dialogue and discovery, cultivate engagement through active learning, leverage technology to promote inclusion, and center inclusive, decolonized approaches. My classroom practices focus on structured retrieval, flexible participation, and creating spaces where students can connect course material to their lived experiences.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">Teaching is about continuous growth and innovation. I remain committed to learning from my students and colleagues, expanding access through flexible delivery modes, and implementing universal design principles to create equitable learning environments for all students.</p>

                            <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2">Introduction to Latin</h4>
                            <p class="mb-4">In the summer session of 2008, I designed and delivered a first-year Latin course to undergraduate students. We met regularly to review readings and cover grammatical concepts.</p>
                            
                            <p class="mb-4">One of my favorite aspects of this experience was watching students master challenging content and grow in confidence with each lesson. Learning a language that is rarely spoken requires students to practice memorizing new terminology and grammar until they can instinctively recognize words and the concepts they imply.</p>
                            
                            <p>Part of the joy of teaching a class like this comes from being alongside students as they tackle this task. I know from my own studies how challenging it can be, so I'm always eager to dive in, share struggles, and offer tips to help them along the way.</p>

It was at Western that a mentor shared a piece of advice that has stayed with me ever since: <em>"When teaching, you can be the Sage on the Stage or the Guide from the Side."</em></p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4">That well-known maxim has stuck in my head ever since. I began to think carefully about when to step forward as an authoritative voice guiding students through complex material, and when to step back to let students take ownership of their learning. Finding a balance between these approaches became a central focus of my classroom practice.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4">Teaching this course twice allowed me to significantly evolve my methods. In the first iteration, I relied too heavily on lectures. Student feedback made clear they wanted more interactive discussions and collaborative exploration. For the second offering, I restructured each session into three distinct segments:</p>

                            <p>Later, my time at Quest University deepened my reflection on teaching approaches when I received additional insight: while students at Quest appreciate their instructors delivering an occasional "knowledge bomb"— an interlude in which instructors offer a deep-dive into their area of expertise — the majority of the class is best spent in idea generation and refinement.</p>

Each course provided a unique space to engage with students, unpack complex texts and artifacts, and encourage thoughtful discussion and analysis.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4">Building on lessons learned from Quest University about active learning and student engagement, I structured these courses to balance content delivery with meaningful student participation. Rather than relying on lengthy lectures, I incorporated varied engagement strategies and encouraged students to connect classical materials to their own experiences and understanding.</p>

                                <p>In this mixed-level course on Catullus and Horace, I moved beyond traditional translation-focused instruction by positioning myself as someone who had once struggled with these texts (Latin is hard!).

                    <p class="mb-4">From those first steps as a Teaching Assistant to leading classrooms and coaching fellow educators, my teaching journey has been driven by a commitment to inclusion, evidence-based strategies, and meaningful engagement.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">Along the way, I've developed skills in curriculum design, student mentorship, public speaking, and team facilitation. Every class, every workshop, and every conversation has reinforced my belief that learning is a collaborative, transformative experience—and I'm proud to play a role in creating spaces where that transformation can happen.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">Looking ahead, I remain committed to leveraging technology and evidence-based strategies to create more equitable learning environments, while maintaining an openness to learning from my students and colleagues. This includes expanding access through flexible delivery modes, implementing universal design principles, and using learning analytics to identify and address barriers to student success.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">By integrating research on cognitive science with culturally responsive pedagogy, while continuously refining approaches based on diverse student experiences and feedback, I aim to approach teaching innovation with both humility and enthusiasm. My goal is to contribute to lasting, positive change in how we make higher education more inclusive and accessible for all learners.</p>
